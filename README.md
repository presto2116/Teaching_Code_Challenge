#Presto's Movie Search

##By: Preston Straight

For this project I created a simple sinatra app to show my skills in sinatra(not my best backend...), javascript and css. 
I was able to create an app that allows users to search through the movie database, OMDB, and see details about a movie. If he/she likes the movie, they can save it to the data.json file.
I was unable to fulfill the requirement of pushing my app to heroku. Since OMDB uses http and heroku only uses https, the app does not seem to work. I do have a heroku link, which is https://gentle-cove-6620.herokuapp.com/, but it does not allow the user to search for a movie.
